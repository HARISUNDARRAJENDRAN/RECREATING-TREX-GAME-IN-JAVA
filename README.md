Here is my attempt to recreate one of the most popular games (T-Rex game) using my current knowledge in Java.

Overview
The T-Rex Game is a basic side-scrolling game where you control a T-Rex character to avoid obstacles. The T-Rex automatically moves forward, and your task is to jump over or duck under obstacles to survive as long as possible.

How to Play
Jump: Press the spacebar to make the T-Rex jump over obstacles.
Restart: If the T-Rex collides with an obstacle, the game ends. Press spacebar to restart and try again.

Features
Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly generated obstacles, including cacti and birds, challenge the player's reflexes.
Scoring System: Earn points for each obstacle successfully avoided.
Simple Controls: Only the spacebar key is needed to play the game.

Getting Started
Compile the Code: Compile the provided Java source code using a Java compiler.

Run the Program: Execute the compiled program to start the game.

Controls: Use the spacebar to jump over obstacles.

Game Mechanics
Gravity: The T-Rex falls downward due to gravity. You need to time your jumps carefully to clear obstacles.
Obstacle Speed: Obstacles move towards the T-Rex at a constant speed.
Customization
Adjust Gravity: Modify the GRAVITY constant to change the speed of the T-Rex's descent.
Obstacle Speed: Adjust the speed of obstacles by changing the movement speed in the move() method of each obstacle.
